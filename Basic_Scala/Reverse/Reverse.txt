   By the light of the moon.
Yet we'll go no more a roving
   And the day returns too soon,
Though the night was made for loving,

   And love itself have rest.
And the heart must pause to breathe,
   And the soul wears out the breast,
For the sword outwears its sheath,

   And the moon be still as bright.
Though the heart be still as loving,
   So late into the night, 
So, we'll go no more a roving
